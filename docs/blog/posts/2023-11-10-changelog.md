I'm trying out a new format to encourage me to write more. I'm calling it the ✨ *Changelog* ✨.

<!-- more -->

  > A changelog (also spelled change log) is a log or record of all notable changes made to a project. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changelog)

However, in my case, I will be documenting significant changes in my life. Each changelog will follow the [semantic versioning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-semantic-versioning) system, which is a standard approach used in software development to indicate changes in a project. These changes can be either major ( 🚨 breaking!) or minor (🩹 patches). In this changelog, I will include updates on discoveries, project advancements, and any other noteworthy developments that I feel deserve an update - big or small.

Without further ado, here is the first release of my Changelog! 🎉 Version 0.1.0 🎉

**📕 Learned:**

- 🕸 I'm taking a web development course and became curious how Python web-frameworks like Django, Flask, and FastAPI work. Been enjoying reading these articles:
    - [What is Gunicorn in Python](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Gunicorn-in-Python/answer/Michael-Herman-3)
    - [What is Werkzeug](https://testdriven.io/blog/what-is-werkzeug/)
    - [What are WSGI and CGI in plain English](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4929626/what-are-wsgi-and-cgi-in-plain-english/5120610#5120610)
- 🤖 Exciting to try out OpenAI's new Assistants API in my projects.
    - [OpenAI Assistant API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/how-it-works)
- 📼 Pydantic is all you need [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=FG0yzBfx3yn9yEPT&v=yj-wSRJwrrc&feature=youtu.be)

**✨ New:**

- 📈 I've been aware of [`yfinance`](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) for years. Recently, I discovered a nice alternative [`yahooquery`](https://github.com/dpguthrie/yahooquery). The documentation is great and I wish `yfinance` had similar docuemntation and consistent docstrings like `yahooquery`.
- 🐍 Saw a [tweet](https://x.com/kennethreitz42/status/1722612751594639450?s=46&t=c2FZR_cXkQ5f4r3C6yAgfg) about this cool Python package called [Magentic](https://github.com/jackmpcollins/magentic) which integrate LLMs as Python functions.

**🚨 Changed:**

- Changed blog site to [MkDocs-Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) from [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/).
