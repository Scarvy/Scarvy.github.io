During the past two weeks, I have been traveling, but that hasn't stopped me from staying up-to-date with the latest articles, blogs, podcasts, and videos. Whether I was waiting at the airport or sitting on the plane, I made sure to keep myself entertained.

Now that I'm back, there is a lot to catch up on, so without further delay, I am excited to announce the release of version 0.4.0 üéâ!

## üó£ Quotes

[How to Increase Your Luck Surface Area](https://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area)
> "If there's one thing I've discovered in recent years it's this. The amount of serendipity that will occur in your life, your Luck Surface Area, is directly proportional to the degree to which you do something you're passionate about combined with the total number of people to whom this is effectively communicated. It's a simple concept, but an extremely powerful one because what it implies is that you can directly control the amount of luck you receive. In other words, you make your own luck."

## üê¶ Social Media

I have terrible handwriting that is difficult to decipher, but ChatGPT Vision can read it with ease!

- [ChatGPT Vision](https://x.com/fortelabs/status/1734284384537333813?s=46&t=c2FZR_cXkQ5f4r3C6yAgfg) saw this post that using ChatGPT Vision makes it really easy to transcribe handwritten jounr entries in digital text.

## üé• Videos & üéôPodcasts

- I recently listened to an episode of [The Colin & Samir Show](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-colin-and-samir-show/id1379942034) podcast where they discussed some of their favourite videos on YouTube with their guest Dan Mace (link [here](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-colin-and-samir-show/id1379942034?i=1000638189839)). One of the videos they mentioned was ["Follow the Frog" by Max Joseph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=N7s1rix6_9yxd00Q&v=EmF701R4JCU&feature=youtu.be) , which I found fascinating. The editing style in the video was captivating, and I noticed some similarities with some of my favourite vloggers like Casey Neistat. Although I'm not an editor and have only edited one video in my life, I have a lot of admiration for the art of storytelling through the medium of video. I'm looking forward to watching more videos from Max Joseph and other creators like him, and maybe even trying my hand at editing my own video.

- [Made You Look: A True Story of Fake Art"](https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/made-you-look-review-barry-avrich-1234913471/amp/) is a documentary that explores the world of art forgery and the most successful forgery scam in the high-end art world.  After seeing the Rothko paintings in the documentary. I realized that I had seen a similar painting before in Mad Men. A quick google realized I somewhat right, but as explained in this [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/madmen/comments/7lco0i/til_coopers_painting_from_s2e7_is_fictional/) it was not a real Rothko ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
