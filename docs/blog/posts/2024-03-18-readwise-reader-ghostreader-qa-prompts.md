I learned how to automatically create Q&A flashcards (aka *Q&A Mastery* cards) in Readwise using Reader's *Ghostreader* feature.

<!-- more -->

The only thing you need to do is open any document in Reader, open *Ghostreader*, highlight a word, sentence, or paragrpah, and run this prompt:

```text
Below is text from {{ document.title }}:

"""
{% if (selection | count_tokens) > 1000 %}
{{ selection | central_sentences | join("\n\n") }}
{% else %}
{{ selection }}
{% endif %}
"""

Write a question-and-answer pair based on the selected text. 
The output should always start with '.qaâ€™ and the question should always end with a question mark â€˜?â€™. 
The answer should be at the end and always end with a period â€˜.â€™
```

Watch as it creates a new note that automatically generates a new flashcard in Readwise.

## Step-by-step

1. Open *Ghostreader* menu and select "Custom":![reader-ghostreader](../images/reader-ghostreader.png)

4. Go to *Readwise* and you should see new *Q&A Mastery* card!: ![readwise-bookreview-page](../images/readwise-bookreview-page.png)

## The Secret Sauce

The key is the prompt the model to use Readwise's *Action Tags*.

![Reader_ Frequently Asked Questions](../images/Reader-FAQ-Action-Tags.png)

To create a *Q&A Mastery* card you need to add a note starting with `'.qa'` and the questions needs to end in a question mark `'?'`. Readwise will identify this a new card and automatically create it on its next sync.
