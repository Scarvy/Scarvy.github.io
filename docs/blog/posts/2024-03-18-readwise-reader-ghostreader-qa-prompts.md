I learned how to automatically create a QA flashcards in Readwise using Reader's _Ghostreader_ feature.

<!-- more -->

The only thing you need to do is open any document in Reader, open the _Ghostreader_ menu, paste this prompt into the "Custom" prompt text window and hit enter.

```text
Below is text from {{ document.title }}:

"""
{% if (selection | count_tokens) > 1000 %}
{{ selection | central_sentences | join("\n\n") }}
{% else %}
{{ selection }}
{% endif %}
"""

Write a question-and-answer pair based on the selected text. 
The output should always start with '.qaâ€™ and the question should always end with a question mark â€˜?â€™. 
The answer should be at the end and always end with a period â€˜.â€™
```

That's it ðŸŽ‰!

Navigate to the document's "Book Review" section in Readwise and you should see a flashcard like this:

## The Secret Sauce

The key is the prompt the model to use Readwise's _Action Tags_.

![Reader_ Frequently Asked Questions](../images/Reader-FAQ-Action-Tags.png)

One of these tags is ".qa" which allows someone to create a Q&A Mastery Flashcard.
