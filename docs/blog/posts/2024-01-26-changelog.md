[awesome-readwise](https://github.com/Scarvy/awesome-readwise) - A curated list of awesome Readwise libraries, plugins, software, and resources.

<!-- more -->

GitHub has a section on the [Explore](https://github.com/explore) page called [Topics](https://github.com/topics).

One of these topics is called *"Awesome Lists"*. *"Awesome lists"* are a list of things curated by the GitHub community. If you can think of a topic, it is safe to assume it has a list for it. Here are some of my favorites:

1. [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python)
2. [the-book-of-secret-knowledge](https://github.com/trimstray/the-book-of-secret-knowledge)
3. [papers-we-love](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love)
4. [awesome-mac](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/awesome-mac)
5. [awesome-machine-learning](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning)
6. [awesome-logseq](https://github.com/logseq/awesome-logseq)
7. [awesome-behavorial-interview](https://github.com/ashishps1/awesome-behavioral-interviews)
8. [github-cheat-sheet](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet)

Dating back to last summer, I have beeing using [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) and their read-it-later app [Reader](https://readwise.io/read). It has completely changed how I consume content on the internet. Plus, it has been the perfect companion tool for my notetaking/ knowledge capture system - Logseq.

I had created two open-source projects using their APIs for fun and was curious about other projects on GitHub that also used them. To my amazement, I found a plethora of open-source projects that people had built from client libraries to integration tools and open-source software.

I saw that there wasn't a list yet for these projects and other resources, so I started "awesome-readwise". I already have found tons of interesting projects from it from AI integrations to flashcard makers.
