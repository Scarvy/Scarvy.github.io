## üìï Read

There is no doubt that LLMs will have a significant impact on education. These systems have the potential to provide personalized learning experiences tailored to a student's individual learning style, and they can be available 24/7! I have come across helpful tools such as [Khanmigo](https://www.khanacademy.org/khan-labs) and [ed](https://edstem.org/about) that utilize this technology to assist students in their learning process.

As I prepare to begin my graduate studies next year, I am considering how best to incorporate these tools into my coursework to enhance my learning experience.

After attempting to read documentation like a book, I've grown more curious about the elements of good documentation. I've come across several informative articles on the topic:

- [How to Write Code Documentation](https://www.madcapsoftware.com/blog/write-code-documentation/)
- [API Documentation Guide and Best Practices](https://stoplight.io/api-documentation-guide)
- [What is code documentation](https://swimm.io/learn/code-documentation/code-documentation-benefits-challenges-and-tips-for-success)
- [About READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)
- [Developer documenting done right: why, who, what, where, when & how](https://swimm.io/blog/developer-documenting-done-right)
- [Documentating Python Code: A Complete Guide](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/)

One of my favorite blogs is Rodrigo's [Mathspp](https://mathspp.com/blog) blog. This week, I read a few of his articles:

- [What is *args and how do you use it?](https://mathspp.com/blog/what-is-args-and-how-do-you-use-it)
- [Why use enums?](https://mathspp.com/blog/why-use-enums)
- [In conversation: Rodrigo and Stephen discuss analogies when learning to code](https://mathspp.com/blog/in-conversation-rodrigo-and-stephen-on-analogies)
- [5 ways to flatten a list of lists](https://mathspp.com/blog/5-ways-to-flatten-a-list-of-lists)

Lastly, I had read other pieces of content.

- **The Coding Career Handbook:**
  - [Marketing Yourself (Without Being a Celebrity)](https://learninpublic.org/v1-tactics-marketing-yourself.pdf)
  - [Intro to Tech Strategy](https://learninpublic.org/v1-strategy-intro-tech.pdf)

- [Money Stuff: Who Controls OpenAI](mailto:reader-forwarded-email/79fff38ccf79824882bde2de01d3b4cc)  
- [The Pocket Guide to Debugging](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/12/21/new-zine--the-pocket-guide-to-debugging/)

I really enjoyed reading Julia's blog post on debugging. It served as a great reminder to always keep a clear head when troubleshooting. I even printed it out and pinned it to my bulletin board above my monitors as a helpful reference. üëç

## üß∞ Tools

A new tool I came across and one I have been using for a few months now:

- [markdown-crawler](https://pycoders.com/link/11789/feed): A Python web crawler tool that generates markdown files from web pages for RAG (retrieval augmented generation) use cases.

- [Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/read): A web app for all your reading needs and can sync up with your notetaking apps like Notion, Obsidian, and Logseq (which I use).
  
    I have been using this tool since July, and it has been a complete game-changer for me in terms of organizing my reading materials, notes, and learning comprehension. 
    
    Furthermore, it has made it much easier for me to organize these changelog blog posts. The app provides a seamless experience that allows me to tag any document (articles, videos, blog posts, PDFs) and highlight directly in my browser or in the web app. I highly recommend this app!
    
    In fact, I even created a CLI for it, which you can find by clicking on this link: [`readwise-reader-cli`](https://github.com/Scarvy/readwise-reader-cli).

## ‚ú® New

No major updates for projects, but created a new repo to help in the development of my Textual app.

- Created a new repository [`yahoo-finance-api-collection`](https://github.com/Scarvy/yahoo-finance-api-collection).

    I created this repository because I was tired of sifting through the code between two wrapper libraries, namely [`yfinance`](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) and [`yahooquery`](https://github.com/dpguthrie/yahooquery), that wrap around the Yahoo! Finance API. 
    
    I started using an open-source alternative to Postman called Bruno. Bruno uses its own markdown language called *Bru* and is designed to live inside the API's project folder, which works nicely with version control. I have been using it constantly for my project and have found it to be quite useful. 
    
    Recently, Bruno added cookie support and bumped the version to 1.0.0, signaling a stable release. I plan to continue using this tool for future API discovery and testing.
