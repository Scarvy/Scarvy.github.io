## 👥 Testimonials

- > “Scott’s technical mastery, general curiosity, growth mindset, and wide range of capabilities, he would be a dream fit for any institution.  He was always eager to enhance his skills and take on new challenges... has a natural sense of ownership, collaborates easily and productively, and can smell a good solution to a problem, and has what I can only call a grasp of the aesthetics of good software design (he naturally grasps the time to effect modularity and how to factor code into pieces of the right size and focus).”
- > ""Scott has demonstrated an ability to work well across a matrix environment, quickly adapting and expanding his scope while delivering high-value projects... [and] has really shown what it means to have a change management mindset, proposing new ways of developing projects that will improve efficiency and production time."
