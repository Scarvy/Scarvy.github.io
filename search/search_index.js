Programmers are simply the people who are so dedicated to building software that they're willing to stay at the edge of the craft and learn and use every tool no matter how sophisticated or complex it is.</p> <p>Today's programmers use a different set of tools and languages as will tomorrow's. So tomorrow's programmers will be doing natural language programming but they will be every bit as dedicated, skilled, intense, and applying effort as in the past. So I still don't think that high-end computing gets democratized. Here is the key difference. The key difference is that when you program something, software can go to a billion users and it's the same software. So people always just demand the best.</p> <p>As opposed to where if we're digging ditches and now we all get bulldozers, it is truly democratized because one ditch is not better than the others and building more ditches still takes more effort. So because programming is winner-take-all within a given domain, the specialist programmer will continue to dominate over the journalist who's just telling the computer to write the code.\" </p> <p>...</p> <p>Zbynek Drab: So the ideal large language model is sort of like the reverse of the genie from the classic fairy tales where you typically get exactly what you asked for but something else than you meant and a well-designed language model will give you exactly what you mean no matter how clumsily and crudely you phrase it.&gt;</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2024/01/16/the-changelog---v070.html","title":"The Changelog - v0.7.0","text":"<p>For as long as I can remember, my browser always has tons of bookmarks.

Process is about consistently making time and energy to practice every day, rather than intensely pursuing a creative project and then burning out, falling out of love with it, and becoming resentful. It\u2019s about creating a lot of work that meets a standard I set for myself.</p> </li> <li> <p>Picasso said, \u201cInspiration exists, but it has to find you working.\u201d *</p> </li> <li> <p>\u201cMany people die with their music still in them,\u201d physicist, poet, and polymath Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. said. \u201cToo often it is because they are always getting ready to live. Before they know it, time runs out.\u201d</p> </li> <li> <p>Spend three hours on Saturday reading a book outside of the genre you normally read. You may find that a clear answer emerges from expanding your horizons.</p> </li> <li> <p>In reality, we don\u2019t need anything except our brains and bodies to practice our creative work. The goal is to put this reality into practice with the fewest tools possible, in any environment.</p> </li> <li> <p>\u201cThe most important thing I noticed today was that only in stillness can we recognize movement.\u201d \u2014 Marina Abramovi\u0107</p> </li> <li> <p>There is no universal creative process. But any creative process will involve various periods of incubation, or time spent not consciously thinking about the problem. You have likely experienced this phenomenon yourself when after hours at work spent agonizing over a problem, the solution pops into your head when you get home and take the dog for a walk. This is also known as The Shower Principle\u2014ideas come to you when you\u2019re doing something else, like taking a shower, doing the dishes, or working on another problem entirely.</p> </li> <li> <p>Throughout the years, we are conditioned to do things well and to constantly improve. If we\u2019re not doing that, we\u2019re led to believe we\u2019re getting worse. If we regress, we are failures. These beliefs are all based on the flawed assumption that progress is linear. At an extreme, this could lead us to chase perfection. If we can\u2019t do something perfectly, we just won\u2019t do it. Perfectionism creates an impossible standard for us to meet. This is just one of many reasons we start procrastinating and get blocked.</p> </li> <li> <p>There will be a time and place to care about results\u2014but it\u2019s not while you do the work.</p> </li> <li> <p>As Wired co-founder Kevin Kelly writes, \u201cStart by buying the absolute cheapest tools you can find. Upgrade the ones you use a lot. If you wind up using some tool for a job, buy the very best you can afford.\u201d</p> </li> <li> <p>In 2018, the average Instagram user on Android spent 53 minutes a day on Instagram. Over the course of the year, that\u2019s 322 hours, the equivalent of over eight full 40-hour work weeks.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the professional world, a popular productivity strategy is the Pomodoro method: set a timer for 25 minutes of uninterrupted time to complete a task, take a five-minute break, then start the timer again. After three of these 25 minute sessions, the person takes a longer 30-minute break.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you\u2019re programming, restrict yourself to a set number of lines of code or a specific memory size. (Sizecoding might be an inspiration.)</p> </li> <li> <p>This is what Michael Saviello says of his process: \u201cI do a painting in a short amount of time, but I think about it 24 hours.\u201d</p> </li> <li> <p>This is how originality actually works: not through a mythological lightning bolt of insight, but through constant bricolage, rediscovery, and remixing of references.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"blog/archive/2024.html","title":"2024","text":""},{"location":"blog/archive/2023.html","title":"2023","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/changelog.html","title":"Changelog","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/web-development.html","title":"web development","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/personal.html","title":"Personal","text":""}]}
