# Programming

## [Effective Pandas: Patterns for Data Manipulation](https://a.co/d/2HUckyE)
### By Matt Harrison
### Summary
I thought I knew the Pandas library, but after discoving this book it was eye-opening to realize how much I didn't know. Matt does an incredible job how to get the most out of the library while breaking down each component into digestionable steps. I found myself looking at this book more than Google-ing or looking-up on Stackoverflow - it made me better using the library 100x.

### Summary
Content creator and programmer Corey Shafer's YouTube channel contains videos on a variety of Python topics from building Django apps to setting up Python environment's and so much more! Easily, one of the best channels to learn about Python for beginner and experienced Pythonist. I come back to his channel to learn about Python.
