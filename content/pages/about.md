Title: About

I'm a programmer from Boston. I have a passion for coding and love to experiment with things. I previously worked at State Street Associates, State Street's quantitative research arm, working with academic's from Harvard and MIT developing new investment tools for investment analysis for some of the largest asset owners in the world.

These days, I mostly write in Python, but hope to explore other languages like C++, Rust, and TypeScript.
