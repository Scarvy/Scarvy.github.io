# About me

I'm a programmer and technology enthusiast from Boston, MA. I have a passion for coding and love to experiment with things. I previously worked at [State Street Associates](https://www.statestreet.com/us/en/asset-manager/solutions/research), State Street's quantitative research arm, working with academics from Harvard and MIT to develop new investment tools for some of the largest asset owners in the world.

These days, I mostly write in Python but hope to explore other languages like C, Rust, and TypeScript.
